## Session 2: Wednesday 30th August 2023

### Task 1: Reviewing the data collected from Session 1

#### Climate Change:

##### Q1. How would you describe your understanding of the current environmental issues impacting marine ecology?
People have some basic knowledge, but are aware there is a lot more to learn
##### Q2. Have you ever participated in any activities or initiatives related to environmental conservation? Can you describe this experience?
A variety of answers, some 'no', many people 'do their bit' and there are a one or two exceptional examples (cleaning beaches etc). 
##### Q3. In your opinion, how can we better educate the public about the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems?
Most answers suggest that young children at school age should be taught this. It should be also be disseminated through social media and by example through individual actions. 
##### Q4. What role do you think individuals can play in mitigating the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems?
While individuals can't have an impact by themselves, there needs to be a greater momentum of all individuals and this should involve businesses. 
##### Q5. How do you feel about the idea of using games as a medium to raise awareness and educate about environmental issues?
While there is some scepticism, games are seen positively. They are fun, tend to be less 'preachy' and can easily be aimed at the young target audience. 

#### Board Games:

##### Q1. Can you describe your experience with board games? Which ones have you played and enjoyed the most?
There is a broad awareness and engagement with this across most participants. They are seen as a family passtime, and most people have played more traditional games such as Monopoly.
##### Q2. In your opinion, what makes a board game engaging and enjoyable?
Team play, simple, short, competitive, engaging for all ages
##### Q3. What were the names of any climate themed games you have played? If so, what was the experience like? 
Very few people have played games in this genre. There is one response called 'Planet'
##### Q4. How do you think board games can be used to educate players about important topics, such as environmental issues?
Raising awareness, learning through trivia questions, making learning fun, rewarding positive choices, consider contraversial choice (self interest vs the broader good)
##### Q5. If a board game was designed to simulate a marine ecology, what elements or features would you expect or want to see in it?
Sharks and a variety of species. The impact of human interaction / human living footprint. 2 - 8 players. Rewarding positive decision making. 

### Task 2: A high level collection of ideas and concepts to pick from
#### Game Types: Snakes and Ladders
A Journey
Nothing too complicated
Keep the board simple, include the complexity in the cards
#### Game play: 
Finding a balance
Team play versus self-interest. 
Accumulating points for prizes
A secret mission (a secret bad-guy i.e. Among Us)
Beating the family, ensure winners and losers
Handing out 'bad' cards to other players (maybe some bad cards are good for other players?)
#### Game Content:
A variety of species - humans, ocean based, land based
Building a balance of species - e.g. 5 Urchins, 3 starfish, 7 algae = a complete ecosystem




## Session 1: Wednesday 5th July 2023

### Task 1: What are the Challenges and Opportunities we face during this project?

#### Opportunities:
1. Learning and Skill Development:
Gaining new skills, understanding game theory, and applying personal knowledge.

2. Community and Social Engagement:
Building teamwork, enjoying social interaction, and working towards a shared goal.

3. Educational Impact:
Enhancing educational content, particularly related to environmental awareness.

4. Personal and Global Contribution:
Making a positive difference in the world and contributing to environmental awareness.

5. Fun and Creativity:
Encouraging creativity and enjoyment through the process of creating a game.

#### Challenges:
1. Logistical and Time Constraints:
Managing time and balancing other commitments.

2. Experience and Knowledge Gaps:
Overcoming a lack of experience in research, gameplay, and content depth.

3. Diversity and Representation:
Addressing questions about diversity within the group.

4. Game Design Considerations:
Deciding on game objectives, design, complexity, and the nature of the competition.

5. Psychological Factors:
Handling disagreements, listening to each other, and managing creativity-related anxiety.

6. Humorous Observations:
Managing the amount of food provided (reflecting a lighthearted aspect of the group interaction).

### Task 2: How might we use the collected data and our own ideas to create a game?

#### Understanding and Engaging Players:
Identify popular board games and understand player engagement.
Gauge preferences for setup ease, play speed, competition, and game type (card or board).
Explore whether the subject is niche and assess the potential gap in the market.

#### Design and Creativity:
Research graphics, symbols, colors, and keywords for game design.
Consider both individual choices and collective empowerment in game mechanics.
Assess whether to have a national or international focus in the game.

#### Education and Environmental Awareness:
Investigate existing climate-themed games and understand their appeal.
Determine how educational the game should be and how design can captivate players.
Understand existing environmental knowledge levels and use research to inform design.

#### Collaboration and Community:
Explore how collaboration in games can foster environmental understanding.
Consider shifting focus from individual actions to community efforts.
Use research to collect diverse perspectives and turn complex topics into relatable ones.

#### Market and Practical Considerations:
Assess public interest in environmental games and find out if there's a market demand.
Debate the appropriateness of card vs. board game formats.
Reflect on the balance between complexity, fun, educational value, and potential impact.

## Plan for next session (Wednesday 30th August 2023)

#### 1. Review the data you have collected (probably as smaller groups, or one group depending on how many people)
#### 2. Review existing board game concepts (I will bring some examples in), what do we think about using one of these as a format?
#### 3. How can we use the data we have collected to inform our design (what are the key considerations?)
#### 4. Brainstorm ideas:
  #### 4.1 an abstract, really high level, overview of a game idea based on ecologies / climate change
  #### 4.2 how can we apply that idea to a board game concept / genre?
#### 5. Homework - collect more data (use the same form, but ask more specific questions related to this session) & reflect on this session

## Next Session (Weds 11th October) LETS DESIGN A BOARD GAME
